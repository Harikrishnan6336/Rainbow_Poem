Then there was in a jungle
The jungle had lot of animals in it.
Lion was their king.
Fox was their minister.
The forest was their kingdom
But unknown to the  common folk their lied a mysterious air of delusion in the forest
This edit is just a random one.
But it means a a lot to me
.......

I am back in 2020, And I know You know Why?
Being int he Home- a whole lot of time,
Searching for the mid-night star
Wallowing into the space lake
Seen a wave in there, Peace Work
Not so shining, yet glooming.

Saw behind the ones supposed to hide the sun,
Something in a red, no its Walking away
Or may me going be against it to opposite,
But I sigh still, that not glance again.
To silence from the far.
And from the far away ocean.
There is a light above the ocean.
