Then there was in a jungle
The jungle had lot of animals in it.
Lion was their king.
Fox was their minister.
The forest was their kingdom
But unknown to the  common folk their lied a mysterious air of delusion in the forest
This edit is just a random one.
But it means a a lot to me
.......

I am back in 2020, And I know You know Why?
Being int he Home- a whole lot of time,
Searching for the mid-night star
Wallowing into the space lake
Seen a wave in there, Peace Work
Not so shining, yet glooming

Not so busy, diving deep in the woods,
Where there go I, coming not seemingly there
So soon into the wildflowers
Not hitting me though, so I glad
